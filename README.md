## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project helped me become more comfortable with Tailwind CSS and its utility-first approach to styling. It also deepened my understanding of Flexbox and Grid layout techniques. Additionally, I learned how to implement different background images for various screen sizes.

### Continued development

I would also like to continue practicing more complex layout techniques, especially working with Flexbox and Grid

### Useful resources
